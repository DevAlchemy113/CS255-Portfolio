Project Overview
The DriverPass project focused on designing a web-based system to help students better prepare for their DMV driving exams. The client, DriverPass, identified that a large percentage of students fail the exam when relying only on traditional study methods. To address this problem, DriverPass wanted a system that combines online practice tests with on-the-road driving lesson scheduling. The system needed to support multiple user roles, including students, instructors, office staff, and administrators, while also providing secure payment processing, progress tracking, and reporting features.
Project One focused on gathering and documenting business and system requirements, while Project Two translated those requirements into a detailed system design using UML diagrams and technical specifications.

What I Did Well
One of my strongest areas in this project was clearly defining system requirements and translating them into realistic system behavior. In Project One, I identified both functional and nonfunctional requirements that addressed security, usability, scalability, and performance. In Project Two, I effectively modeled these requirements using UML diagrams, including use case, activity, and sequence diagrams.
The activity diagrams clearly show user workflows such as logging in, scheduling lessons, checking package eligibility, taking practice tests, and receiving confirmations. The sequence diagram helped illustrate how the system components interact during lesson scheduling, including validation, availability checks, reservation creation, and notifications. Together, these diagrams accurately represent real-world user interactions and system responsibilities.

What I Would Improve
If I were to revise part of my work, I would expand the diagrams to include additional exception and edge cases, such as failed payment transactions, system downtime, or partial lesson cancellations. While the current diagrams capture the main workflows and decision points, adding more exception handling would make the design even more robust and production ready.


User Needs and System Design
User needs played a central role in my design decisions. From the requirements phase, I focused on making the system accessible to users with varying technical skill levels. This influenced design choices such as clear dashboards, validation messages, confirmation notifications, and role-based access control. Ensuring that students could easily schedule lessons, track progress, and receive feedback was critical to meeting DriverPass’s business goals.
Considering user needs is important because a system’s success depends on usability as much as functionality. Designing around real user workflows reduces confusion, improves efficiency, and increases overall satisfaction.

Design Approach and Modeling Techniques
My approach to designing software begins with understanding the business problem and user requirements before moving into technical solutions. For this project, I used both process modeling and object modeling techniques. Process modeling helped me visualize workflows such as registration, scheduling, and testing, while object modeling allowed me to define core entities like customers, instructors, lessons, vehicles, packages, and tests.
I found object modeling particularly valuable for long-term system design because it supports scalability and future enhancements, such as adding new lesson packages or updating test content. When combined with process modeling, these techniques provided a complete and well-structured view of how the DriverPass system should function.
In future projects, I plan to continue using structured requirement analysis, UML modeling, and iterative refinement to design systems that align with both business objectives and user needs.
